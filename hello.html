<h1>A little story</h1>
<p1>The Story of the Starfish</p1>
<p>
 A man was walking along the ocean at dawn. Suddenly, he saw thousands of starfish washed ashore.
 As he got closer, a boy noticed. The boy was picking up the starfish one by one and returning them to the sea.
 The man approached the boy and asked, "Why are you throwing these starfish back into the sea?"
 The boy replied, "The sun is rising. Soon the tide will recede, and these starfish will die of thirst."
 The man was surprised: "The beach is so long, and there are so many starfish. You can't save them all. What difference does it make?"
 The boy listened to the man. Then he picked up another starfish from the beach and released it into the sea. Then, turning to the man,
  he said, "See, it makes a difference for this starfish.".</p>
